In many restaurantscustomers may order children meal which may vary from one restaurant to
another, however, the process is same. Children's meals typically consist of a main item, a side
item, a drink, and a toy (e.g., a hamburger, fries, Coke, and toy dinosaur). Despite possible
variation in the content of the children's meal, the construction process is the same. Whether a
customer orders a hamburger, cheeseburger, or chicken, the process is the same. The employee at
the counter directs the crew to assemble a main item, side item, and toy. These items are then
placed in a bag. The drink is placed in a cup and remains outside of the bag.
